Hi,

Tadi is off on holiday so I have decided to publish the last (and half) week in Serverless.

Scheduler adds schedule deletion after completion("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/amazon-eventbridge-scheduler-deletion-completion/")
I haven't used EventBridge in a while but the new scheduler looks cool so it is nice to see that AWS are continuing to add features to it including schedule deletion after completion. 

Lambda Python 3.11 Support("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/aws-lambda-python-3-11") 
For you snake lovers, you will be happy to learn that AWS continues to support Python. I like Python. 

Database Encryption SDK("https://docs.aws.amazon.com/database-encryption-sdk/latest/devguide/what-is-database-encryption-sdk.html")
Client side encryption is made easy by the new release of the Database Encryption SDK. Someone told me encryption was important one time. 

Public IPV4 Charges("https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/breaking-aws-begins-charging-for-public-ipv4-addresses/")
AWS has announced that it will start charging for public IPV4 addresses.

Security Heroes("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-the-first-aws-security-heroes/") 
Security Heroes is a new thing and AWS has kickstarted the group by announcing 6 heroes. You can see their faces here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-the-first-aws-security-heroes/("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-the-first-aws-security-heroes/")

Cheerse, 
I volunteer @April Bates("mailto:aprilb@aleios.com")  as tribute for next week
