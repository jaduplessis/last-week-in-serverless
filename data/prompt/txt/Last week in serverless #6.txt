Hi, folks!

Here are all of the serverless, serverless-adjacent or just plain exciting announcements that I could find from last week. Enjoy!
Amazon DynamoDB now simplifies and lowers the cost of handling failed conditional writes (link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-dynamodb-cost-failed-conditional-writes/")) - Get a copy of the item as it was at the time of a failed conditional write in the failure event rather than having to hit Dynamo again to read it
Amazon S3 provides restore status of S3 Glacier objects using the S3 LIST API (link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-s3-restore-status-s3-glacier-objects-list-api/")) - Nice QOL feature - pass a header to your API call and get the restore status of any in progress or recently restored objects.
