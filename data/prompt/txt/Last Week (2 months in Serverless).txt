Hi Everyone,

I know it's been a while since we've had a last week in Serverless. I think now that reinvent is over we can get it started again.

So here is a list of what was announced recently in the serverless world.

 Ability to call external endpoints with Step Functions("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/external-endpoints-and-testing-of-task-states-now-available-in-aws-step-functions/") 
- You now also have the ability to rerun specific failed tasks in a standard step function
- The ability to run individual steps instead of the entire step function for testing

Lambda now scales faster("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-functions-now-scale-12-times-faster-when-handling-high-volume-requests/")
- Lambda can now scale by a 1000 every 10 seconds and not just 500 anymore
- Lambda will now showcase future runtime support next to deprecation dates 
- Lambda now has the ability to log in JSON format, each searching ahead and querying ahead 

Cloudwatch log pricing cut in HALF("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-cloudwatch-log-class-for-infrequent-access-logs-at-a-reduced-price/")
- Logs now cost $0.25 instead of $0.50!
- Cloudwatch Log pattern Grouping
- Anomaly detection now on logs and not just metrics anymore

DynamoDB zero ETL integration with Open search("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-dynamodb-zero-etl-integration-with-amazon-opensearch-service-is-now-generally-available/")
- Included is Redshift zero ETL integration 

GraphQL (Appsync) and Aurora integration for querying("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/build-a-graphql-api-for-your-amazon-aurora-mysql-database-using-aws-appsync-and-the-rds-data-api/")

Serverless Elasticache("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elasticache-serverless-for-redis-and-memcached-now-generally-available/")
- No more capacity planning for elasticache 
- Ability to choose between Memcache and Redis 

Open search Vector engine("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/vector-engine-for-amazon-opensearch-serverless-is-now-generally-available/")
- This is now generally available 

Integrated Application Testing Kit("https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-integrated-application-test-kit/")
- This is cool, but currently limited to Python

Here are some example articles, I tried focusing on what was released during Reinvent, I am sorry if I missed anything.

Definitely suggest the DynamoDB article, really cool.

I nominate @Andre Du Plessis("mailto:andredp@aleios.com") for the next one.

Enjoy the weekend.
