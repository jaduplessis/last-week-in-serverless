Hello team!

It might have felt like it's been more than 7 days since the last mail, but welcome to the fifth Last Week in Serverless!
AWS Glue now can detect sensitive entity types from over 50 countries before writing it into their repositories: link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-glue-250-entity-types-50-countries/")
AWS Step Functions announces the availability of Versions and Aliases, improving resiliency for deployments of serverless workflows: link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-step-functions-versions-aliases/") 
(Less Serverless but still cool!) AWS Amplify announces the UI Builder Figma plugin, empowering design and development teams to seamlessly collaborate within a Figma file: link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-amplify-ui-builder-figma-plugin/")
AWS Lambda now supports starting from a specific timestamp when using Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) or Self-Managed Kafka: link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-lambda-starting-timestamp-kafka-sources/") 
Amazon CloudWatch Logs announces new Log Insights dedup command: link("https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-clouwatch-logs-insights-dedup-command/") - quite a handy tool we could likely utilise more! 
In addition to some serverless articles, here are some more product-focused articles I think were interesting!
Is your team making decisions in a silo? Evidence-based design can help.("https://blog.coalesce.nyc/is-your-team-making-decisions-in-a-silo-evidence-based-design-can-help-4efb87be42ba")
5 Reasons Why Product Quality Matters("https://www.business.com/articles/5-reasons-why-product-quality-matters/")
