      "content": "  Amazon GuardDuty EC2 Runtime Monitoring is now generally available \n Posted On:  Mar 29, 2024 \nToday, AWS announces the general availability of Amazon GuardDuty EC2 Runtime Monitoring. This feature deepens threat detection coverage for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). It gives you visibility into on-host, operating system\u2013level activities and provides container-level context of detected threats. It complements runtime coverage already available for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate, giving you comprehensive runtime visibility and detection across popular AWS compute services.\u00a0\nGuardDuty Runtime Monitoring helps you identify and respond to potential threats, including instances or self-managed containers in your AWS environment that are querying IP addresses associated with cryptocurrency-related activity or making connections to a Tor network as a Tor relay. Threats to compute workloads often involve remote code execution that leads to the download and execution of malware. GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring provides visibility into suspicious commands that involve malicious file downloads and execution across each step, providing earlier discovery of threats during initial compromise\u2014before they become business-impacting events.\u00a0\nTens of thousands of customers across many industries and geographies use GuardDuty. You can enable GuardDuty EC2 Runtime Monitoring in a few steps in the GuardDuty console. GuardDuty will immediately begin collecting and analyzing runtime event activity for potential threats. Using AWS Organizations, you can centrally enable runtime threat detection\u2014including automated agent management\u2014for accounts and workloads across the organization to simplify your security coverage.\u00a0\nThis feature is generally available in all AWS Regions where GuardDuty is available, excluding AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and AWS China Regions.\nTo learn more and get started, try GuardDuty EC2 Runtime Monitoring for 30 days at no cost on the AWS Free Tier. You can also subscribe to feature updates with the Amazon GuardDuty SNS topic.\n Learn About AWS\n Resources for AWS\n Developers on AWS\n Help\n Ending Support for Internet Explorer\n",

This capability launches with an ML model that helps companies create lookalike segments. With AWS Clean Rooms ML lookalike modeling, you can train your own custom model using your data and invite your partners to bring a small sample of their records to a collaboration to generate an expanded set of similar records while protecting the underlying data with purpose-built privacy controls. AWS Clean Rooms ML enables collaborative ML use cases including those for healthcare, financial services, and travel and hospitality. \nOrganizations across industries strive to use their data to unlock insights that help acquire customers and improve business processes while protecting consumer privacy and intellectual property. AWS Clean Rooms ML lookalike modeling helps you collaborate with your partners to create ML-powered lookalike segments without having to share or exchange sensitive data. For example, a consumer brand can now collaborate with a media publisher to find new customers that are similar to their existing, best customers, without having to share or upload their sensitive data. Similarly, healthcare customers can recruit participants for clinical trials or medical research using a seed list of participants with the desired characteristics. With AWS Clean Rooms ML, you retain full control and ownership of your trained models, and you can use intuitive controls that help you and your partners tune the model\u2019s predictive results. \nAWS Clean Rooms ML was built and tested across a wide variety of datasets such as ecommerce and streaming video, and it can help customers improve accuracy on lookalike modeling by up to 36%, when compared with representative industry baselines. \nAWS Clean Rooms ML is available as a capability of AWS Clean Rooms in these AWS Regions.

      "content": "  Amazon SageMaker Canvas announces new pricing for training tabular models \n Posted On:  Mar 29, 2024 \nWe are excited to announce new pricing for training custom tabular models in Amazon SageMaker Canvas, a no-code tool that enables customers to easily create highly accurate ML models without writing code. SageMaker Canvas supports numeric prediction (regression), 2 category prediction (binary classification), 3+ category prediction (multi-class classification), and time-series forecasting for tabular models. Previously, model training charges were based on the number of cells in the dataset used to train the model. Now, the charges are based on SageMaker training and processing hours used to train the model.\u00a0\nThe new pricing is cost-effective, enables quick iteration, and provides consistent pricing to train custom models across different modalities in SageMaker Canvas. Previously, model training in Canvas incurred a minimum of $30, and the cost increased with higher cell count. Now, the training charges for tabular models are based solely on SageMaker instance hours used, thereby significantly lowering the overall training cost. For example: A quick build model with 16 MB of data with about 3 million cells can now be as low as under $2, and a standard build model, which runs a comprehensive AutoML experiment may use 2 ml.c5.18xlarge instance hours and still cost you only $7.30.\u00a0\nThe updated pricing is now available in all AWS regions where SageMaker Canvas is supported. You will see SageMaker training and processing charges for various instance types, including ml.m5.12xlarge, ml.c5.18xlarge, and ml.m5.4xlarge, that Canvas automatically selects based on performance and availability. The pricing for these instances can be found at Amazon SageMaker pricing.

Today, Amazon DataZone has introduced an integration with AWS Lake Formation hybrid mode. This integration enables customers to easily publish and share their AWS Glue tables through Amazon DataZone, without the need to register them in AWS Lake Formation first. Hybrid mode allows customers to start managing permissions on their AWS Glue tables through AWS Lake Formation, while continuing to maintain any existing IAM permissions on these tables.\nTo get started, administrators enable the data location registration setting under the DefaultDataLake blueprint in the Amazon DataZone console. Then when a data consumer subscribes to an AWS Glue table managed through IAM permissions, Amazon DataZone first registers the Amazon S3 locations of this table in hybrid mode, and then grants access to the data consumer by managing permissions on the table through AWS Lake Formation. This ensures that IAM permissions on the table continue to exist with newly-granted AWS Lake Formation permissions, without disrupting any existing workflows.\nThe integration between Amazon DataZone and AWS Lake Formation hybrid mode is generally available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (London), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo). \nYou can read more about these new updates in the user documentation.\n Learn About AWS\n Resources for AWS\n Developers on AWS\n Help\n Ending Support for Internet Explorer\n",

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN is a fully managed LoRaWAN Network Server that supports cloud connectivity for LoRaWAN-based wireless devices. Using the new metrics feature, developers can now quickly capture system health data, such as connection signal strength, data rate, and gateway latency and analyze their fleet\u2019s performance.\nThe metrics feature collects, aggregates, computes, and stores key historical device operational data for LoRaWAN-based devices and gateways. Developers can use these data sets to build software dashboard applications that can help fleet operators get a holistic view on their fleet\u2019s performance and help streamline their fleet monitoring routine. Using the metrics feature, developers can quickly identify and address potential operational problems, reduce disruptions caused from device or gateway malfunction, and lower costs associated with system troubleshooting and field maintenance workflows. To access the metrics feature, developers can use the AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN console and opt into the feature. They can also use APIs to integrate these metrics into their own software applications.\nThis new feature is available in all regions where AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN is available.
