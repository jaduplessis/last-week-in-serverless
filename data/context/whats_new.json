With today\u2019s launch, you can get access to local detuning, taller geometries, and tighter geometries - opening up new research opportunities, such as advanced combinatorial optimization problems that are relevant for various industry applications.\nBraket Direct is designed to expand how you can explore quantum computing on AWS, offering device reservations, expert advice, and experimental capabilities. Experimental capabilities are emergent new features that enable you to explore the cutting edge of quantum computing and unlock new use cases, as the technology matures. For instance, local detuning allows for more control over the individual qubits. With taller and tighter geometries, you can rearrange atoms in different ways and simulate novel Hamiltonians on Aquila. Some experimental capabilities may operate outside of standard device specifications and need hands-on guidance tailored to your use case. To ensure your workloads are set up for success, access is therefore available by request only via Braket Direct. \nYou can use these new capabilities with both on-demand and dedicated device access in all AWS Regions where Braket is available, at no additional charge. Researchers at accredited institutions can also apply for credits to support experiments on Braket through the AWS Cloud Credits for Research program. To get started, submit an analog program to Aquila using the Braket Developer Guide and explore the \u2018maximum weight independent set\u2019 problem and other example notebooks.\n Learn About AWS\n Resources for AWS\n Developers on AWS\n Help\n Ending Support for Internet Explorer\n",

Accessible via the AWS Elemental MediaLive console and API, workflow monitor discovers and visualizes resources. It creates signal maps showing video across AWS Elemental MediaConnect, MediaLive, and MediaPackage along with Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront to provide end-to-end visibility. With the workflow monitor, you can create your own alarm templates or start from a set of recommended alarms, and build custom templates for alarm notifications.\nPreviously, monitoring live video workloads and applying best practices required consulting multiple user guides and manually configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms and Amazon EventBridge rules. No single overview existed in the AWS Management Console where customers could view alarms, metrics, resource alerts, and the health across an entire media workflow. Now with the workflow monitor, you can discover and visualize all the resources associated with your live video workflow in just a few clicks. Alarm configurations and notifications are managed and adjusted from one location and programmatically deployed by workflow monitor using Amazon CloudFormation in a repeatable fashion.\nThe workflow monitor is available in all regions where AWS Elemental MediaLive is currently deployed. CloudFormation support for workflow monitor resource types is coming soon.

This new protocol, in addition to RTMPS, expands options for live streaming and helps to maintain video quality when sent across varying network conditions.\nSRT is a modern protocol designed to improve streaming over unreliable networks and protect against jitter, packet loss, and network bandwidth fluctuations, to make streams more stable. For viewers, this results in a higher quality viewing experience with less buffering.\nAmazon IVS is a managed live streaming solution that is designed to be quick and easy to set up, and ideal for creating interactive video experiences. Video ingest and delivery are available around the world over a managed network of infrastructure optimized for live video. Visit the AWS region table for a full list of AWS Regions where the Amazon IVS console and APIs for control and creation of video streams are available.\nTo get started, please refer to: Streaming with OBS Studio using SRT.\n Learn About AWS\n Resources for AWS\n Developers on AWS\n Help\n Ending Support for Internet Explorer\n",
