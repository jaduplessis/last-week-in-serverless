Then when a data consumer subscribes to an AWS Glue table managed through IAM permissions, Amazon DataZone first registers the Amazon S3 locations of this table in hybrid mode, and then grants access to the data consumer by managing permissions on the table through AWS Lake Formation.

You can select key client-side performance parameters and CloudFront delivery performance parameters in the same log record. This can help you correlate variations in Quality of Experience (QoE) for your viewers to CloudFront performance at the granularity of single viewer sessions, simplifying the troubleshooting of QoE issues that impact your viewers engagement.\nCMCD is a standardized way for transmitting client-side performance data from your media player. The CMCD specification outlines a set of key-value pairs like bitrate, buffer length, object playback duration, measured throughput, and other key values that provide insight into the media player performance. Your media player can use the CMCD standard and send the performance parameters in the HTTP request headers or query string to CloudFront.\nPreviously, CloudFront logged CMCD parameters as part of the full query string log field, or the HTTP headers log field. Now, you can simply select to include specific CMCD parameters in your real-time logs and save on compute needed to search and extract the CMCD key-value pairs, and reduce the data set for your log analysis.\nTo enable CMCD in your CloudFront real-time logs, follow the developer guide. To learn more about using CMCD in a custom observability dashboard, refer to the Improving video observability with CMCD and CloudFront Blog. The real-time logs are charged based on the number of log lines that CloudFront publishes to your log destination, to learn more, visit the CloudFront pricing page.\n Learn About AWS\n Resources for AWS\n Developers on AWS\n Help\n Ending Support for Internet Explorer\n",

Customers can make payments through UPI mobile app simply by using a Virtual Payment Address or UPI ID linked to their bank account.\nTo pay with UPI, customers can log-in to the AWS console, and use UPI from the Payments page through the Billing Dashboard. They can then pay for an invoice by choosing UPI from the \u201cAdd Payment Method\u201d drop-down. Customers will be required to provide their UPI ID, verify it, and then proceed to make a payment. After confirming their billing address, customers will receive a payment request in the UPI mobile app (such as Amazon Pay, PhonePe, GPay) associated with their UPI ID. Customers can complete the payment in the UPI app by approving the transaction with their UPI PIN.
