Amazon CloudWatch announces support for streaming of daily metrics on CloudWatch Metric Streams. With Metric Streams, you can create a continuous, near real-time stream of metrics to a destination of your choice. You can use Metric Streams to send metrics to your data lake on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), or AWS Partner solutions including Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, Dynatrace and Sumo Logic. This new capability provides additional metrics for streaming, adding daily metrics with timestamps up to two days old.

To get started with Metric Streams, click on the Streams option from the left menu of the CloudWatch console under the Metrics menu. Once you create a stream, Metric Streams will automatically stream daily metrics. In addition to the CloudWatch console, you can also use the CloudWatch API, AWS SDK, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation to provision and configure Metric Streams.

Streaming of daily metrics on Metric Streams is now available in all commercial AWS Regions, including the Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, and the AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) Regions. To learn more about Metrics Streams pricing, refer to the Amazon CloudWatch pricing page. To learn more about Metric Streams, please refer to our documentation.

Output:
{
  "commentary": "We all love metrics, but often want to get them out of CloudWatch for analysis and monitoring elsewhere, be that into S3 for ingestion by Athena or Snowflake or into a third party service like NewRelic or Datadog. CloudWatch Metric Streams allow us to do this and this update has extended the metrics that we can stream to include daily metrics with a timestamp up to two days old."

We are excited to announce that Amazon OpenSearch Serverless can now scan and search up to 10TB of time series data which includes one or more indexes within a collection. OpenSearch Serverless is a serverless deployment option for Amazon OpenSearch Service that makes it simple for you to run search and analytics workloads without having to think about infrastructure management. With the support for much larger datasets than before, you can further enhance unlocking valuable operational insights and make data driven decisions to troubleshoot application downtime, improve system performance, or identify fraudulent activities. 

OpenSearch Serverless’ compute capacity used for data ingestion, search and query are measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs). These OCUs are shared among various collections. To accommodate larger datasets, OpenSearch Serverless now supports 200 OCUs for indexing and search respectively, doubling from the previous limit of 100, including redundancy for AZ outages and infrastructure failures. You configure the maximum OCU limits on search and indexing independently to manage costs. You can also monitor real-time OCU usage with CloudWatch metrics to gain a better perspective on your workload's resource consumption.

The support for larger workloads and collections for OpenSearch Serverless Service is now available in 8 regions globally: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland). Please refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability. To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see the documentation. 


Output:
{
  "commentary": "Analysing time-series data is often an exercise in frustration, so being able to index and search up to 10TB using OpenSearch is a big deal if you're in to that sort of thing (which I am!)"

AWS AppConfig now supports dynamic parameters, which enhance the functionality of AppConfig Extensions by allowing you to provide parameter values to your Extensions at the time you deploy your configuration. AWS AppConfig Extensions are customizable actions that AWS AppConfig can invoke during the lifecycle of configuration data. Dynamic parameters empower you to supply inputs at Extension invocation time, rather than when they’re initially associated to your AppConfig resources.

Dynamic parameters expand the power of AWS AppConfig Extensions by enabling you to customize the behavior of your Extensions on a per-deployment basis, unlocking new use cases. For example, if your Extension enforces a change control calendar, you can use dynamic parameters to supply a ticket URL as justification for deployment during blocked days. You can also use dynamic parameters to provide an override destination to an Extension that stores backup configurations on deployment. Another use-case would be to send a notification only if a set of user IDs are supplied during the deployment.

AWS AppConfig Extension dynamic parameters are available in all commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

To get started, use the AWS AppConfig Getting Started Guide or our AWS AppConfig documentation.


Output:
{
  "commentary": "Hot on the heels of the new L2 constructs for AppConfig comes an update to AppConfig Extensions. Extensions allow you to perform an action, like backing up a configuration or masking sensitive data, whenever a configuration is deployed. You can now provide them with dynamic parameters, which will allow you to provide context to a specific deployment and use that within the Extension."

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) announces Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) support for Linux containers running on AWS Fargate. With this support, applications running on AWS Fargate can easily authenticate with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to access network shared resources.

Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) is a managed account that provides automatic password management, service principal name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate management to administrators over multiple servers or instances. This allows multiple containers or resources to share an AD account without having to authenticate each container or resource individually, or without having access to network-shared resources such as SQL Server hosts, or file-shares. Until today, customers could use gMSA with Amazon ECS Linux containers on EC2 using credentials-fetcher integration. Now, the same capability is available for containers running on AWS Fargate without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.

This capability is available in all regions where AWS Fargate is available. To learn more and to get started, please refer to the documentation for using gMSAs for Linux containers and blog post.


Output:
{
  "commentary": "Ever wanted to authenticate your containers running on Fargate with an Active Directory to pick up a config file in a shared network location? Now you can!"
}
