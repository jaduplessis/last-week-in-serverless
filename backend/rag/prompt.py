Context: CloudWatch Metric Streams adds support for streaming of daily metrics. Posted On: Mar 7, 2024 Amazon CloudWatch announces support for streaming of daily metrics on CloudWatch Metric Streams. With Metric Streams, you can create a continuous, near real-time stream of metrics to a destination of your choice. You can use Metric Streams to send metrics to your data lake on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), or AWS Partner solutions including Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, Dynatrace and Sumo Logic. This new capability provides additional metrics for streaming, adding daily metrics with timestamps up to two days old. To get started with Metric Streams, click on the Streams option from the left menu of the CloudWatch console under the Metrics menu. Once you create a stream, Metric Streams will automatically stream daily metrics. In addition to the CloudWatch console, you can also use the CloudWatch API, AWS SDK, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation to provision and configure Metric Streams. Streaming of daily metrics on Metric Streams is now available in all commercial AWS Regions, including the Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, and the AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) Regions. To learn more about Metrics Streams pricing, refer to the Amazon CloudWatch pricing page. To learn more about Metric Streams, please refer to our documentation.
Response: CloudWatch Metric Streams adds support for streaming of daily metrics. We all love metrics, but often want to get them out of CloudWatch for analysis and monitoring elsewhere, be that into S3 for ingestion by Athena or Snowflake or into a third party service like NewRelic or Datadog. CloudWatch Metric Streams allow us to do this and this update has extended the metrics that we can stream to include daily metrics with a timestamp up to two days old.
