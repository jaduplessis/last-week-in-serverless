       "[\"- This post offers information on DynamoDB Partitions.\\n- DynamoDB powers high-traffic systems worldwide, including Amazon.com's shopping cart, real-time ad platform bidding, and low-latency gaming applications.\\n- DynamoDB's popularity is due to its fast, consistent performance regardless of scale.\\n- The consistent and predictable scaling properties of DynamoDB are due to basic computer science principles, not superior computing power.\",\n",
       " \"- This post will delve into DynamoDB partitions: what they are, why they matter, and how they should influence data modeling.\\n- Understanding DynamoDB partitions is crucial for comprehending DynamoDB's behavior and the rationale behind its API restrictions and single-table design principles.\\n- Initially, the DynamoDB API may seem unnecessarily restrictive, and single-table design principles may seem bizarre.\\n- However, once DynamoDB partitions are understood, the reasons for these aspects become clear.\\n- The post will cover the following sections:\\n  - (List of sections to be covered)\",\n",
       " \"- The section starts by discussing the basics of partitions in DynamoDB.\\n- To understand this, it's necessary to review some basic concepts about DynamoDB tables.\\n- DynamoDB is a schemaless database, so it doesn't verify the shape of items written into a table.\\n- However, a DynamoDB table isn't completely formless, as a primary key must be specified when creating the table.\\n- Each item written into the table must include this primary key, which uniquely identifies each item.\\n- There are two types of primary keys in DynamoDB: a simple primary key consisting of a single element known as the partition key. An example of a table with a simple primary key is provided.\",\n",
       " '- The table stores Orders for an e-commerce application.\\n- The primary key, on the left side of the table, is the \"OrderId\", marking it as a partition key.\\n- Each Order item in the table contains the \"OrderId\" property, which is unique for each item.\\n- The second type of primary key is a composite primary key.\\n- A composite primary key is made up of two elements: a partition key and a sort key.\\n- An example of a table with a composite primary key is shown.',\n",
       " \"- The table stores the same Orders as the previous table and also includes information about each Order's Customer.\\n- The primary key now consists of two parts: a partition key of CustomerId and a sort key of OrderId.\\n- Similar to the simple primary key, each item in this table will need to include both elements of the primary key.\\n- The combination of these two elements uniquely identifies each item in the table.\\n- Both primary key structures include a partition key element, which is crucial to DynamoDB's infinite scaling capabilities.\",\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB tables are distributed across multiple computers, not a single machine.\\n- Each computer holds a subset of the table's data called a 'partition'.\\n- Partitions enable essentially infinite scaling of a DynamoDB table.\\n- When writing an item to a table, the request is handled by a frontend service called the request router.\\n- The request router does not store data but routes the request to the correct partition.\\n- It parses the partition key from the item and hashes it.\\n- Based on the hashed partition key value, it determines which partition to write the item to.\",\n",
       " '- DynamoDB hashes the partition key before placing it on a partition to better distribute data across partitions.\\n- If sequential identifiers were used as partition keys without hashing, it could lead to hot partitions for certain access patterns.\\n- MongoDB follows a similar principle, as explained in a separate resource.\\n- In the provided image, the request router determined that the incoming item belonged to Partition 1 and sent the request there for handling.\\n- Reading items from DynamoDB follows a similar flow: the request router parses the partition key, routes the read request to the appropriate partition, reads the data, and returns it.',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB partitions are approximately 10GB each; additional partitions are created as the table grows.\\n- A small table could have 2-3 partitions, but a large one could have thousands.\\n- The system scales effectively due to the request router's work in locating the correct node being an O(1) time complexity operation.\\n- Crucially, regardless of the number of partitions in DynamoDB's horizontal scaling, the request router's job remains a fast, consistent operation - reducing the size of the table from multiple terabytes to a more manageable 10GB.\\n\",\n",
       " '- Partitions in DynamoDB are transparent to users.\\n- Users do not need to know or specify partitions when reading or writing items.\\n- The request router handles partition selection and routing automatically.\\n- The specific partitions are unknown to users, as requests go through the request router.\\n- An undisclosed hash function is used to place items in partitions.\\n- This is different from some NoSQL databases where clients can directly access specific partitions.',\n",
       " \"- Using a shared request router leads to a slight performance reduction due to an additional network hop.\\n- Clients are not aware of partitions easing understanding for DynamoDB users.\\n- Clients do not need to request and maintain cluster metadata when interacting with DynamoDB, reducing the initial and ongoing data requirements.\\n- This unawareness enhances DynamoDB's ability to provide strong performance guarantees.\\n- Previously, understanding partitions and request distribution was important for high-scale tables.\\n- Provisioned throughput was distributed equally across all partitions, requiring capacity planning for the busiest partition.\",\n",
       " \"- In 2018, DynamoDB introduced adaptive capacity for partitions.\\n- Adaptive capacity allows provisioned throughput to be dynamically allocated to partitions based on demand, rather than being equally distributed.\\n- DynamoDB automatically manages capacity utilization by taking actions like:\\n  - Adding new partitions as data size grows\\n  - Splitting highly-used partitions into sub-partitions for consistent performance\\n- With adaptive capacity, you don't need to worry about balancing partitions manually.\\n- As long as you stay within the overall partition throughput limit, DynamoDB handles efficient capacity utilization.\",\n",
       " \"- Understanding DynamoDB partitions is helpful for building a theoretical mental model of how DynamoDB operates.\\n- The principles of single-table design can seem unconventional when coming from a normalized, relational database background.\\n- Grasping the importance of partitions in DynamoDB provides clarity on its data modeling approach.\\n- Once partitions are understood, the rest of DynamoDB's data modeling becomes more comprehensible.\",\n",
       " '- The importance of primary keys in DynamoDB is due to its partition structure.\\n- The request router uses the partition key to route requests to the correct partition.\\n- DynamoDB encourages including the partition key in requests.\\n- The DynamoDB API consists of three main action types.\\n- Except for the Scan operation, the partition key must be included in DynamoDB requests.\\n- DynamoDB is schemaless outside the primary key due to its partitioning structure.\\n- Access to items in DynamoDB is focused on the primary key, requiring its existence for proper indexing.',\n",
       " '- DynamoDB items have no enforced structure beyond the primary key.\\n- No foreign key relationships or typed columns like relational databases.\\n- Data is associated with the primary key, with no strict schema.\\n- Operates as a key-value store, with keys that can be simple (partition key) or compound (partition + sort key).\\n- Values are opaque blobs without enforced schemas.\\n- Despite being schemaless, data should still have defined schemas maintained in application code.\\n- Schema validation must be handled in the application layer, not relying on the database.',\n",
       " '- Other NoSQL databases use partitioning for horizontal scaling but do not always restrict the API to maintain this benefit.\\n- Careless use of scatter-gather queries to each partition can eliminate the advantages of horizontal scaling.\\n- Efficient queries in DynamoDB can be performed by the attributes in the primary key, not by other attributes in the table.\\n- The table design should reflect this.',\n",
       " '- DynamoDB\\'s partition model necessitates considering data distribution.\\n- A common mistake made by new DynamoDB users is grouping unrelated items in one item collection, which should be avoided.\\n- It is recommended to use a high-cardinality value for the partition key.\\n- For applications with users, \"userId\" is often a suitable partition key, as it distributes users across different item collections.\\n- Using boolean values or enums for partition keys is not advisable due to the low cardinality, which hinders data distribution.\\n- Thoughtful data distribution can help manage complex access patterns.',\n",
       " '- DynamoDB is often criticized for not handling full-text search or complex filtering patterns across the entire application dataset.\\n- For extensive full-text search requirements across the entire application, dedicated search infrastructure is recommended.\\n- However, search needs are often more limited in scope, confined to a smaller subset of the data.\\n- For example, you may want to enable full-text search only for users within a specific organization.\\n- In such cases, DynamoDB can work well by partitioning users by organization.\\n- When a search request comes in, you can retrieve all users for that organization and perform an in-memory search on the results before sending them to the client.\\n- If the search corpus is narrow (e.g., users within an organization), dedicated search infrastructure may not be necessary.',\n",
       " '- Amazon.com retail uses strategic searching in their e-commerce operations according to Rick Houlihan.\\n- When searching for a specific product, the backend refines the search area instead of going through the entire inventory.\\n- A similar strategy can be applied for geo-lookups – breaking down the search into categories like countries, states, cities, geohashes, etc.\\n- After narrowing down the search space in DynamoDB, an in-memory filter can further refine the options.\\n- Understanding the role of partitions can improve efficiency by better segmenting data in DynamoDB.\\n',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB's lack of support for joins is primarily due to its partitioning scheme.\\n- In a relational database, joins involve evaluating and combining portions of separate tables.\\n- This poses two challenges for DynamoDB:\\n    - The relevant data from the tables may reside on separate partitions, requiring additional network hops for separate reads.\\n    - A centralized node would be needed to combine the data from different partitions before returning to the client.\",\n",
       " \"- Clients may wish to join attributes not part of the primary key, conflicting with DynamoDB's emphasis on primary keys.\\n- Relational databases provide complex query planners that account for table structures, indices, and table content statistics.\\n- These challenges are not impossible to overcome in partitioned databases like DynamoDB.\\n- MongoDB provides the $lookup aggregation for outer join operations.\\n- Partitioned relational databases like Vitess support joins.\\n- However, these solutions increase complexity for both DynamoDB backend and users.\\n- Additional complexity also introduces performance variability, a disadvantage for DynamoDB.\",\n",
       " '- DynamoDB requires you to design without the use of joins.\\n- This may result in denormalization or pre-joining heterogenous items into the same partition.\\n- The approach can be selected according to specific requirements.\\n- Regardless of the chosen approach, there will be no uncertainty about performance implications as the application scales.',\n",
       " '- The post discussed DynamoDB partitions, their significance, and their effect on data modeling.\\n- The key lesson is the importance of understanding the philosophy of DynamoDB.\\n- Compared to relational databases, DynamoDB is not as complicated once key principles are learned, leading to an accurate mental model and easier usage.\\n- Readers are invited to share any questions or comments on the piece.',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB's eventual consistency model is a common criticism, with concerns about its use in critical applications.\\n- Eventual consistency can introduce complications, but these can be managed in most cases.\\n- Even strongly consistent relational databases can have issues related to isolation or ORM choices.\\n- The benefits of accepting some eventual consistency in DynamoDB can be significant.\\n- The post aims to address concerns around eventual consistency in DynamoDB.\\n- The content will be covered in three sections.\",\n",
       " '- The discussion sets boundaries on the topic of eventual consistency.\\n- Confusion around eventual consistency is prevalent, partly due to the complex nature of database and distributed system consistency.\\n- An in-depth post was written covering three types of consistency, none of which was \\'eventual consistency\\'.\\n- Readers may find it helpful to read that post if the concepts in this background are unclear.\\n- \"Eventual consistency\", in high level terms, refers to a distributed systems model which ensures all accesses to a particular data item return the last updated value after a certain point, given no new updates are made.',\n",
       " '- The definition of eventual consistency outlines what it guarantees, but the key aspect is what it does not guarantee.\\n- It does not promise that any read of a data item will show the most recent updates to that item.\\n- This is the core drawback of eventual consistency - you could update an item, but a subsequent request may not reflect those updates.\\n- Three key aspects of eventual consistency will be discussed, with a focus on DynamoDB:',\n",
       " \"- Eventual consistency is principally related to data replication.\\n- In a single-node database, eventual consistency isn't an issue as writes and reads are centralized, allowing for a consistent view of data.\\n- When data is replicated across multiple nodes, managing eventual consistency becomes more complex.\\n- Upon a write to a node, an efficient way to communicate the write to other nodes is needed.\\n- If other nodes are allowed to read data, the PACELC tradeoff must be considered.\\n- Despite challenges, replication can be beneficial and there may be several reasons to replicate data across multiple locations.\",\n",
       " '- Redundancy: Adding replicas allows for redundancy in case the primary instance fails. Replicas serve as hot standby backups, without being actively read from (except during failure scenarios). This does not introduce eventual consistency implications on its own. This is the default mode for MongoDB replicas, where all read requests go to the primary node unless configured otherwise.\\n\\n- Increase throughput: Replication can be used to increase processing throughput. Write operations go to the primary node, but reads can be distributed across secondary nodes. This approach, similar to adding read replicas in relational databases, increases the available nodes for read traffic and allows handling more requests per second. However, it introduces the eventual consistency issues discussed in the post.',\n",

       " \"- The Dynamo and DynamoDB papers detail impressive technical concepts along with in-depth discussions on user needs.\\n- Both papers examine established practices to evaluate their significance and potential need for reconsideration.\\n- The Dynamo paper revealed the lesser use of certain higher-level querying functions of an RDBMS within Amazon's services.\\n- Werner Vogels later emphasized that 70% of database operations were single-record primary key lookups and another 20% read multiple rows from a single table.\",\n",
       " \"- The original Dynamo paper highlighted that the strong consistency guarantee isn't necessary for all applications.\\n- Enhanced availability and reduced write latency achieved by relaxing consistency requirements can provide significant benefits.\\n- The DynamoDB paper re-assessed traditional database systems concepts and evaluated user needs to broaden Dynamo's application.\\n- As a result, DynamoDB established unique product priorities setting it apart from many other databases.\\n- The paper provides three critical observations on user needs.\",\n",
       " '- Consistent performance at any scale is often more important than median request service times for many users.\\n- It\\'s better to have a narrower range between median and tail latency than reducing median, p90, or p95 latency.\\n- DynamoDB\\'s performance story is more nuanced than just being \"super fast.\"\\n- RDBMS latency worsens as the amount of data in the database increases, while DynamoDB provides consistent performance as data grows.\\n- The same relationship holds as the number of concurrent requests increases.\\n- The key point is DynamoDB\\'s consistent performance at scale, versus varying latency in RDBMS as data and concurrency grow.',\n",
       " \"- At certain data and transaction volumes, an RDBMS may have faster response times than DynamoDB.\\n- This is conceptually understandable, as a DynamoDB request passes through multiple systems (request router, metadata system, authentication system) before reaching the physical storage node, adding latency.\\n- In contrast, a single-node RDBMS can operate directly on local data, avoiding much of this overhead.\\n- While MySQL may outperform DynamoDB at the median, it's important to consider the full spectrum of database performance for two reasons.\",\n",
       " \"- Tail latencies are crucial, especially in architectures with many components and sub-components.\\n- If a single backend call triggers multiple calls to underlying services, the request is more likely to experience tail latency from some service, resulting in slower responses.\\n- DynamoDB's consistent and predictable performance profile reduces long-term maintenance burden on the service.\\n- There is no need to investigate, tune, and refactor as performance declines over time.\\n- The performance in the test environment will match the performance years after launch, allowing focus on value-generating features for users.\",\n",
       " \"- The topic discusses the advantages of fully managed services over self-managed services in cloud and serverless contexts.\\n- Serverless environments aim to focus on unique business elements and delegate undifferentiated tasks.\\n- The transformation within Amazon retail and the creators of Dynamo (not DynamoDB) illustrates this idea.\\n- The Dynamo system had a substantial impact and significantly improved Amazon's scalability and availability at a vast scale.\\n- Despite these advancements, many engineers preferred using Amazon SimpleDB (AWS's initial entry into the hosted NoSQL database market) over managing Dynamo themselves.\",\n",
       " \"- Amazon SimpleDB is a lesser-known service; it is succeeded, and in most aspects, surpassed, by DynamoDB.\\n- Despite being less promoted by AWS, SimpleDB signifies AWS' policy of never deprecating a service, even if superior ones exist.\\n- SimpleDB has major drawbacks, one of them is a strict 10GB size limit for the entire database.\\n- This limit was a significant issue, especially for large-scale applications - yet, engineers opted to use multiple SimpleDB tables, likely implementing sharding at the application layer.\\n- While this added complexity to the application logic, engineers still preferred SimpleDB over operating their own Dynamo instance.\\n- This pattern influenced the development of Amazon DynamoDB, a database merging the scalability of Dynamo with the fully managed characteristic of SimpleDB.\",\n",
       " \"- User data often isn't distributed as evenly as desired.\\n- Ideally, users have stable and predictable traffic that evenly distributes data access across keyspaces, but actual scenarios differ.\\n- The original Dynamo paper outlined consistent hashing to distribute data across around 10GB-sized independent partitions.\\n- This system uses an item's partition key to organize data across partitions, enabling predictable performance and seamless horizontal scaling.\\n- Unlike the original Dynamo system, DynamoDB is a multi-tenant system.\\n- Partitions of different DynamoDB users can be co-located.\",\n",
       " '- Initially, DynamoDB had a system to prevent noisy neighbor issues, where high traffic to one partition could impact other unrelated partitions on the same storage node.\\n- However, this initial system led to a subpar experience for workloads with spiky or unbalanced traffic patterns.\\n- As DynamoDB evolved, AWS realized the need to enhance the access control system that managed whether a partition could service a request.\\n- The technical aspects of this evolution are explored further below.',\n",
       " '- The DynamoDB paper provides interesting technical learnings.\\n- The work done by the DynamoDB team, even at a massive scale, can be applied to smaller scales.\\n- There are three key technical takeaways from the paper.',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB uses log replicas to improve durability and availability during instance failures\\n- To understand log replicas, we need background on DynamoDB's storage architecture\\n- DynamoDB splits data into partitions, which are independent 10GB storage segments\\n- The partition key is used to assign items to a given partition\\n- This allows DynamoDB to scale horizontally as the database grows while keeping related items together\\n- DynamoDB runs a large fleet of storage nodes handling partitions from many different user tables\",\n",
       " '- An individual partition in DynamoDB is a set of three partition instances across different availability zones, forming a replication group.\\n- One instance acts as the leader for a given partition, responsible for handling all writes.\\n- When a write operation occurs, the leader writes the data locally and ensures it is committed to at least one additional replica before responding to the client.\\n- This replication approach increases durability, as the loss of one node will not result in data loss.',\n",
       " '- Every storage partition contains two data structures: the B-tree of indexed data and a write-ahead log (WAL) listing updates applied to the partition.\\n- Write-ahead logs, commonly used in databases, enhance the durability and latency of write operations.\\n- Updating the B-tree is slower due to random I/O and potential re-writing of multiple disk pages.\\n- Write-ahead log updates, being append-only, are much faster.\\n- The concept of write-ahead logs is fundamental to Kafka and similar systems.',\n",
       " \"- Individual operations against B-trees and write-ahead logs present a significant performance difference.\\n- There's a considerable size difference between the two structures. The B-tree can be over 10GB in size (included the partition's 10GB size and the index overhead), while the write-ahead log is merely a few hundred megabytes.\\n- The write-ahead log's full history is periodically synced to S3, enabling point-in-time restore and other features.\\n- This concludes the section on DynamoDB storage background.\",\n",
       " '- In large systems like DynamoDB, instances frequently fail.\\n- When a storage node fails, thousands of partition replicas need to be relocated to a non-failing node.\\n- During the failure period, every replication group with a replica on that node is down to two replicas.\\n- Two replicas are required to acknowledge a write, so write latency increases and the probability of an availability event rises if another replica fails.\\n- To reduce the time with only two live replicas, DynamoDB uses log replicas.\\n- A log replica is a replication group member containing only the write-ahead log.\\n- By skipping the B-tree for the partition, DynamoDB can quickly spin up a log replica by copying the last few hundred MB of the log.\\n- The log replica can acknowledge writes but not serve reads.',\n",
       " '- DynamoDB uses a log replica to temporarily assist the replication group while a full replica member is brought up to replace a failed one.\\n- The DynamoDB team has continuously made incremental improvements to enhance durability, availability, and latency.\\n- These improvements do not alter the core promises of the system, such as the choice made in the CAP theorem.\\n- They represent steady enhancements to the reliability and performance of the database.\\n- DynamoDB employs a standard combination of a write-ahead log with indexed storage to improve durability and reduce write request latency.',\n",
       " '- DynamoDB uses a partitioned system instead of a single-node setup like RDBMSs.\\n- This partitioning reduces recovery time and improves availability, as recovering a smaller partition is faster than a large table.\\n- The data is replicated across three availability zones, ensuring availability even if an entire zone fails.\\n- DynamoDB relaxes consistency requirements, only requiring two out of three replicas to acknowledge writes.\\n- This trade-off of occasional stale data allows for improved write availability and reduced latency.\\n- DynamoDB utilizes log replicas to further enhance availability during node failures.',\n",
       " '- Partitions in a table are used for data segmentation and horizontal scaling.\\n- DynamoDB places partitions from different customers on the same storage nodes to increase service efficiency.\\n- DynamoDB has gradually improved its \"admission control\" system, the process to check if a request can proceed based on available capacity.\\n- The admission control checks capacity across two different factors:\\n  - Making sure the provided service is properly paid for.\\n  - Avoiding performance issues due to the co-location of partitions.',\n",
       " \"- Initially, DynamoDB's admission control was at the partition level.\\n- Total provisioned throughput was divided equally among partitions.\\n- This was a simple system without coordination across partitions.\\n- However, it led to issues with unbalanced workloads and throughput dilution.\\n- Hot partitions could be throttled even when the table was underutilized.\\n- To address this, DynamoDB aimed to decouple admission control from partitions.\\n- But this was a significant change, so they moved in stages.\",\n",
       " '- There were improvements made to the partition-level admission control system.\\n- Each partition was restricted to prevent overuse of resources on a single node.\\n- Storage nodes were often found to run under full capacity.\\n- To handle temporary traffic increases to individual partitions, short-term bursting was added to DynamoDB, letting a partition use extra throughput if available on the storage node.\\n- This improvement mainly addressed the second axis of access control – protection from noisy neighbors.',\n",
       " '- A second improvement addressed the provisioned throughput for an individual table, another aspect of access control.\\n- Skewed access patterns could lead to a table consuming all the throughput for one partition while remaining below the total provisioned throughput for the table.\\n- DynamoDB introduced adaptive capacity to allow throughput from sparsely used partitions to be redirected to highly used partitions.\\n- These modifications, while preserving the general partition-based access control scheme, significantly reduced issues caused by uneven data access patterns.',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB transitioned to a global access control system, decoupling throughput from partitions.\\n- This changed adaptive capacity from a slower, 'best efforts' approach to a near-instant system for distributing throughput across partitions.\\n- This flexibility enabled several improvements:\\n  - Separating hot items onto their own partitions\\n  - Introducing DynamoDB On-Demand billing\\n  - Overloading storage nodes based on predicted partition workloads\\n- Section 4 of the referenced paper provides more detailed information on these changes and is recommended for further understanding.\",\n",
       " '- DynamoDB utilizes asynchronous caches.\\n- Asynchronous caches mean a system that stores data locally and refreshes it in the background to keep it updated.\\n- Caching is used to decrease latency by saving the results of costly calls.\\n- In scenarios given in the study, individual request router objects store the outcomes of external calls locally to evade a slow network query.\\n- Two interesting points can be observed when reviewing DynamoDB\\'s treatment of \"external\" (or \"dependencies\") versus \"internal\" systems.',\n",
       " \"- DynamoDB utilizes other AWS services like IAM for authentication and KMS for encryption/decryption, which are external dependencies not controlled by the DynamoDB team.\\n- DynamoDB caches the results of calls to these external services and periodically refreshes them asynchronously to maintain availability, even if the external services experience issues.\\n- Without caching, DynamoDB's availability would be limited by the availability of services like IAM and KMS.\\n- DynamoDB also employs asynchronous caches for internal systems.\\n- DynamoDB has a metadata system that tracks table information and partition locations.\\n- When a request arrives at a DynamoDB request router, it needs to find the relevant partition for the item to forward the request to the appropriate storage node.\",\n",
       " \"- Metadata information doesn't frequently change, leading to heavy caching by request routers.\\n- The paper states a 99.75% cache hit rate, which is exceptionally high.\\n- A high cache hit rate can lead to issues, such as increased service load due to minor traffic reductions.\\n- Lowering the metadata cache hit rate from 99.75% to 99.5% doubles requests to the underlying metadata service.\\n- The DynamoDB team observed that the metadata service had to scale with the request router service.\\n- New request routers with empty caches caused many calls to the metadata service, destabilizing the overall system.\",\n",
       " '- DynamoDB employs asynchronous cache refreshing to enhance the resiliency of its internal systems and maintain a constant load on the underlying metadata system.\\n- While request routers cache data locally with a high hit rate, each cache hit triggers an associated asynchronous request to the metadata service to refresh the cached data.\\n- By coupling a local cache hit with an asynchronous request to the metadata service, DynamoDB ensures a consistent rate of traffic to the metadata service.\\n- Both cache hits and cache misses result in a request to the metadata service, preventing bursts of new traffic to the metadata service when adding new request routers with cold caches.',\n",
       " '- Metadata caching system has interesting details not covered here.\\n- Two uses of asynchronous caches are highlighted.\\n- Local, instance-based caching was used to reduce latency.\\n- Asynchronous refreshing was coupled with local caching.\\n- Asynchronous refreshing helped decouple availability from external dependencies.\\n- Asynchronous refreshing increased resiliency of internal services.',\n",
