Amazon Data Firehose enables selecting a time zone for bucket prefixes when delivering streams to Amazon S3
Posted On: Feb 16, 2024

Amazon Data Firehose now enables selecting a time zone for bucket prefixes when delivering streams to Amazon S3,

Customers use Amazon Data Firehose to deliver data streams to Amazon S3 data lakes, data warehouses, and analytics services. When delivering streams to Amazon S3, Firehose enables adding a UTC time prefix in the format YYYY/MM/dd/HH before writing objects to Amazon S3. The prefix enables creating a logical hierarchy in the Amazon S3 bucket, where each forward slash (/) creates a level in the hierarchy. With this feature, customers can specify a time zone that they want to use for their Amazon S3 bucket prefix. As a result, customers that want their data in Amazon S3 to use bucket prefixes in a non-UTC time zone format do not have to resort to additional post-processing operations. 
This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Kinesis Firehose is available. To learn more, refer to the Amazon Data Firehose Developer Guide.
```

Output:
{
  "category": "Data Streaming"
}
