Hi all, 

Here is a recap of the last couple of weeks in Serverless (and other things related): 

AWS Lambda Lightweight Runtime (LLRT)
This is my favourite update, which is why I have put it at the top -
"LLRT (Low Latency Runtime) is an experimental, lightweight JavaScript runtime designed to address the growing demand for fast and efficient Serverless applications"

I would like to look into this, if anyone has or wants to look into it - let me know. You can read more here: 
- LLRT GitHub
- InfoQ article 

Sheen Brissals: Serverless Development on AWS
If you haven't checked out this book please do - it features our very own @Ben Ellerby and ex-aleiosüßë‚ÄçüöÄ Sarah Hamilton. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/serverless-development-on/9781098141929/

API Gateway TLS 1.3 
One of the most important releases in the last couple of weeks is that API Gateway now supports TLS 1.3. You can read more about the release here and please reference the documentation for how to configure this.

AppSync Updates 
AppSync has rolled out new features, including environment variables in GraphQL resolvers and functions, and enhanced monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch metrics. These updates bring greater flexibility and observability to your AppSync applications.
- Environment Variables
- Enhanced Monitoring

CodePipeline Upgrade
CodePipeline has had a sizeable upgrade with additional trigger filters and new execution modes including branch based development. You can read more here: 
- Trigger Filters and Execution Modes
- Branch Based Development 

Kinesis Data Firehose Bucket Prefix Extension
Finally there is a small update for Kinesis - Data Firehose now supports time zone specifications for S3 bucket prefixes, making it easier to organize and access your streaming data across global projects. https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/amazon-data-firehose-time-zone-bucket-prefixes/

I nominate @Sol Parker to do the next Last Week in Serverless. 

Have a good weekend all,
```
